# switcher.nvim

A plugin for Neovim for jumping between open buffers

## Disclaimer

This is my first ever Neovim plugin and I am not a lua expert yet, so feel free to use it at your own risk and point out mistakes. It is also a work in progress.

## Roadmap

- Add support to close buffers
- Add support to save buffers
- Add a customizable user commands section on the left side of the switcher
